# MapsUp

## Description
MapsUp is a BLE heads up car display. It provides you with your directions without blocking any of your view by reflecting its instrutions off the windshield of the vehicle. MapsUp is completely hands free and wireless with respect to your phone. The display is simply powered off a car's cigarette lighter. Currently only Android phones are supported.
